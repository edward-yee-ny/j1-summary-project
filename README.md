1. Move Left
2. Move Right
3. Move Forward
Choose your option: <choice>
```

### Movement

- From the starting room, you are allowed to move to the left, forward, or right.
- You will be provided with which directions you are allowed to move in
- However, you will not be able to know which room that you will be moving into

### Combat

- Combat is a turn based system where you are able to fight with monsters
- You are able to utilise weapons and weapons provide additional damage (maybe additonal effects)
- You will also be able to use your inventory
- Using your inventory will not count toward ending your turn, and you can only use items when it is your turn
